# Final_project.py
Its our final project of python 
In this project we are create a 
python quiz game 
In this game we have 15 questions related to python 
1. The program starts by welcoming the player
2. It iterates through each question, showing the question and its options.
3. The user enters their choice for each question.
4. After each choice, the program checks correctness, updates the score, and provides feedback.
5. At the end, it displays the correct answers, the userâ€™s guesses, and their overall score as a percentage.
This is a Python quiz game that uses loops, conditional statements, and lists/tuples effectively to manage and evaluate a quiz.
This project is created by a group of Three members (Rameen,Samina,Bisma)
